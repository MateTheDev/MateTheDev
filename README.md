## About me
### My journey
I discovered the world of programming in 2021 through Roblox Studio, and I tried making copies of games with Youtube tutorials. Over time, I learned Luau and started making my own scripts, focusing mainly on UI scripting, until I started learning Python the same way. I first helped with small things on friends‚Äô projects, and then I made my own. This process of learning languages had taught me a lot about general programming and specific languages as well.

From there, I became really interested in programming, and I focused on learning with tutorials, building up my knowledge.
